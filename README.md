The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has impacted several aspects of our lives and caused severe damage to the American economy. Particularly, grocery stores' supply chains have not been able to keep up with the demand, mainly caused by general panic. Some of the most vulnerable members of our communities may not have access to essential items, which in turn will only exacerbate their current situation. We believe in the power of community and that most of us would extend the hand to our neighbors in times of need. With that in mind, we propose a website to be used during a time of crisis to help connect people in the same community and facilitate the bartering or donation of supplies for those in need.
